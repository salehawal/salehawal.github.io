# Project Modification Instructions

You are the coding agent responsible for updating my existing website project to follow these exact guidelines and changes.

| Coding Guidelines
- The site must be completely native: no external libraries, frameworks, or dependencies.
- All data must be organized and stored in one structured DB file (for example, `data/db.json`), containing categories and records.
- The DB file should be imported and used in pure JavaScript (no server-side rendering) to feed content into the site dynamically.
- The site should have **3 strict layers**:
  1. Data (DB file)
  2. HTML structure (index.htm)
  3. Theme/CSS layout (main.css)
  Each layer overlays the previous one in a structured order.
- All site functionality and logic must be contained in `lib/fun.js`.
- All CSS should be in `main.css`. No inline styles are allowed in HTML.
- All site HTML content should be located in `index.htm`.

| Changes to Implement
1. Add a **responsive menu bar** that:
   - Changes its theme or background color when the user scrolls down.
   - Centers its menu items horizontally.
   - Each menu item should link to an anchor (section) on the same page.
   - Menu Items are (Home, Research, Achivments, Certificates )
2. Add a **light shadow** effect to each block of content for better depth.
3. Replace all icons with **font icons** (for example, via Unicode or custom fonts already available in the project).
4. Add **SEO meta tags** in `<head>`:
   - `<title>` → short descriptive site title.
   - `<meta name="description">` → clear site summary.
   - `<meta name="keywords">` → relevant keywords.
5. Add a **favicon** using the existing image in `assets/favicon.ico`.
6. Ensure everything works smoothly in a single-page structure.

| Additional Notes
- Keep the site responsive for desktop and mobile.
- Maintain a clean and readable code structure.
- Do not add or import any external files or libraries.
- Focus on performance, clarity, and maintainability.
